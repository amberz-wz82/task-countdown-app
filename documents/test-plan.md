I will conduct user testing by letting users read through scenarios for using my app and complete specific actions. I have designed the scenarios to have realistic context as well as actionable steps with enough details.

Scenario 1:
You are a PhD student in a research lab working on publishing Chi paper with other lab members. You want to have a way of tracking the task, "Submit Chi Paper," as its deadline is coming up on October 16th, 2021. You are collaborating with two other PhD students, Amber and Jason, and you want to remind yourself and the other two authors that the deadline is approaching, so your team will be motivated to work harder.

Scenario 2:
You are an undergrad student working on a team project in the class INFO 4340. The project is named "Homework 1," and it is due soon on September 30th, 2021. You want to remind yourself and your teammate, Ian Lee, that the deadline is coming up.
You then realize that you misread the rubric, and Homework 1 is actually due on September 28th, 2021, so you have to update your reminder with the correct information. You also want to make the project name more specific, so you decide to rename the project "HW1: Progressive Web Apps."
